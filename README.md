<p>Framework: Node</p>
<p>Description: </p>
<p>Made a simple async fetch function to get the data from an API that targets meals that starts with "G"</p>
<p>Restructured the data to look like this:</p>
<p>{Title: "",</p>
[{Ingredient: "" , Measure: ""},
{Ingredient: "" , Measure: ""},
{Ingredient: "" , Measure: ""}
<p>]}</p>

To test it:
* Download or clone the repository
* Run npm install
* Open it with Live server and look in the console for the result
</p>
